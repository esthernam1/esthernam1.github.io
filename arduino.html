                        When we have certain emotions, we want to express it to others. For some, it may not be
                         quite as easy to physically portray how you feel. <b>This project was a study aimed to 
                         explore our representation of emotion through a method of digital communication</b>. Towards the
                          end of this experience, users will see the symbolism in the colors and 
                          hopefully will become more aware about how they portray their emotions through technology.

                        1. Use your computer to track your face using FaceOSC. Move around and try different expressions to 
                         capture the mesh on your face.

                     <div class = "space2"></div>
                     
                        2. Once you got your facial recognition going, try changing your expressions to see your facial data
                        translated into a color visualizer on screen using real-time data.

                        3. Finally, another user will be engaged in an immersive environment soley based off of 
                        how you create your facial expressions. The other user must put on the headpiece while you are 
                        in front of the device experimenting with your facial data. Inside the headpiece, the other user
                        will be immersed in a vibrant scene where they can visualize your emotions.

                        <br><br>
                        Learnings: People generally associate the same colors with the same emotions. However, 
                        the level of detail was different among people's emotion.

                        Goal: Discover relationship between facial expression and separate colors 
                        through digital interviews.(Expressions from left to right are Surprised, Happy, Sad, Angry, Disgust).
