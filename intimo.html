                          Feeling nostalgic? Eagerly wait for your audio to be played at a 
                          specific time on the Intimo radio as it will begin playing at a set time on a scheduled day.
                          By using <u>Radio.co</u>, an all-in-one platform that lets users run their own radio station, we were able to schedule 
                          a live broadcast for the day we choose, and then set up an audio player on our site that streams
                           that live broadcast.

                            By using the <u>openweather API</u>, we were able to pull weather data(wind speed, temperature, and humidity) based on
                            the user's zip code input. We also used <u>P5.js</u> to visually generate the weather-controlled ellipses, speed, and 
                            clarity of the background.
