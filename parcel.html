                        other special packages to people local to the city. After interviewing several users who often send mail, I
                         wanted to design a new experience of delivering packages locally and without having to leave your house with just 
                         a few clicks.
                        <br><br>
                        The aim of this app is to send and receive parcels faster and more efficiently, simplify the process, and make it more 
                        accessible by standardizing the prices.

                        By using the <u>openweather API</u>, we were able to pull weather data(wind speed, temperature, and humidity) based on
                        the user's zip code input. We also used <u>P5.js</u> to visually generate the weather-controlled ellipses, speed, and 
                        clarity of the background.
