                        <b>What?</b><br>
                        We created ashtrays made from aluminum cans and velcroed them onto tables.
                        <br><br>
                        <b>Why?</b><br>
                        While scoping out the park, we noticed that there were an extraordinary amount of cigarette butts littering the ground.
                        <br><br>
                        <b>When?</b><br>
                        We got to the park on a Sunday when it opened at 7:30 am so as to be as unintrusive as possible.
                        <br><br>
                        <b>Where?</b><br>
                        We set up in the upper portion of the park where it was predominantly older people playing cards or board games.
                        <br><br><br>
                        <b>Conclusion: </b><br>
                        People did not interact with our ashtrays as we had hoped. Thinking they were trash, or not liking 
                        an intrusion on their routine, they slapped them off of each and every table.

                         <b>What?</b><br>
                         We painted boxes(matching the playground's color) to make building blocks for kids. We also brought a ball that they could use to knock them all down.
                         <br><br>
                         <b>Why?</b><br>
                         We decided that kids would be more willing to interact with anything we placed in the park. The older people seemed content with their routine.

                         <br><br>
                         <b>When?</b><br>
                         We set the blocks up at around 10:30 am on a Saturday.

                         <br><br>
                         <b>Where?</b><br>
                         We set up in the playground in the lower portion of the park. An area more frequented by kids and their parents.
                         <br><br><br>
                         <b>Conclusion: </b><br>
                         The kids swarmed around us as we set them down and played with them for over two hours straight, building with them, knocking them over, throwing them at each other, and eventually when they opened up, they would crawl into them. They avoided the ball for the most part.

                         An iteration on Intervention #2, we painted boxes and made exquisite corpse style designs on them.
                         <br><br>
                         <b>Why?</b><br>
                         To try and guide the way in which the kids interacted with them a little more this time.

                         <b>When?</b><br>
                         We set the blocks up at around 2:30 pm on a Saturday.
                         <br><br>
                         <b>Where?</b><br>
                         We set up in the playground in the lower portion of the park again.
                         <br><br><br>
                         <b>Conclusion: </b><br>
                         When we set up the blocks this time, the kids were a bit older and more violent. 
                         They were unsure at first about whether or not they were allowed to touch the boxes, 
                         but then started interacting with them. They opted to flip the boxes on top of each other 
                         trying to form a structure, and then they decided to try and destroy them. They threw them 
                         on the ground, at each other, and hit them with bats. There was one younger girl who, with the help 
                         of her mom, started building a structure in the way we intended.
